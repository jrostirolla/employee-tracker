# Employee Tracker
## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my supervisors tool for tracking employees!
This is a simple program, using both inquirer and MySQL to built a useful tool for managing employees.

## Future updates
I found that while building out my program, I initial built the SQL database structure to run on id's relating the various tables, which later on proved to be rather annoying, and made displaying the desired information more troublesome than it needed to be. Future updates will include the following:
* MySQL database table structures to be linked with VARCHAR entries rather than INTs
* Tidying up of for loops implemented to solve the ID issue
